# Algorithms_Princeton
My work for the Algorithms Princeton course on Coursera.

I will be doing this course in Python instead of Java and trying to keep the data structures and algorithms as close to the Java implementation as possible. Below is a link to the course, the course textbook and the textbook/course website.
